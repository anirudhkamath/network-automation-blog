# Welcome to my blog!

Hello, my name is Anirudh Kamath. I am a Network Automation engineer, who enjoys spreading knowledge about matters I am passionate about. One of these matters is software tools that help manage computer infrastructure efficiently.

I am attempting to maintain a collection of posts on technologies used in the area of network automation and programmability.
Oh, and please do feel free to open pull requests on my GitHub repository in case you want to contribute as well. I am excited to learn together with you!
